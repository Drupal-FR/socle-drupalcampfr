### Q&A
#### How to find out the container names ?
You can use the command `docker ps` which list all the running docker containers.

#### How to use drush within docker ?
You can use docker within the web container by using the alias `@dev.default` :

```
drush @dev.default status
```

Note : you have to "be" in the docroot folder (eg : `/project/www`)

#### How to import a custom dump

Put the dump in the `backups` folder and then in the **web** container you can use the following command :
```
zcat /project/backups/DUMP_NAME.sql.gz | mysql -u drupal -pdrupal -h mysql drupal
```
